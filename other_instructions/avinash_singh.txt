Hi Mat. I installed the pipeline on a M3 Pro Chipset and couldn't get it to work with osx-arm64 (probably didn't try hard enough, and wasn't linking well with IRAF/PyRAF). If you change the arch to osx-64, it is straightforward as below (after you've installed IRAF)

## Install IRAF

Download https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/archive/refs/tags/v2.18.tar.gz
tar zxf iraf-2.18.tar.gz
cd iraf-2.18/

make 2>&1 | tee build.log
make test

sudo make install
make inplace

# Add this to the .zshrc
export PATH="/Users/avinash/.iraf/bin:$PATH"

## Create and Install Conda Environment

conda install python=3.7
conda create -n pessto
conda config --env --set subdir osx-64

## Install Conda Packages:

conda config --add channels http://ssb.stsci.edu/astroconda
conda install stsci
conda install -c conda-forge astromatic-swarp
pip install PyObjC
pip install pyraf

## Install the Pipeline:

git clone https://github.com/svalenti/pessto.git
cd pessto/trunk
python setup.py install

## Fix cursor issue for macOS:

pip install certifi # to install certificates for macOS
python fix_cursor_macos.py
pip install pickle5
python fix_pickle_macos.py
